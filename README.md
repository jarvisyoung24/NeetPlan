## Usage
To use, navigate to the deployed site: [https://daily-planner-xw7d.onrender.com/](https://daily-planner-xw7d.onrender.com/). From there, users can sign up, or log in if they've already done so. From the homepage, users can see the weather in their area if they've provided a US area code, are provided with fun facts, and can see a list of any events they've scheduled for today. In the navigation there are options to view a calendar, create new events to keep track of, view and alter existing events, and change your user settings, as well as log out.

For the weather section to operate, users need to provide a valid US zip code when they sign up or update their user settings. For event dates to be linked into the calendar, they need to be entered in a mm/dd/yyyy format.
